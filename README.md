# simple-slides
Create and present simple slideshows through an awesome local implementation of Remark, Markdown, Mermaid, and Katex!

## Use
Download the template HTML file. Open it in browser, and then open it in your text editor of choice. You'll very quickly figure it out. HINT: use markdown, and "---" denotes a new slide. :)

### Formatting
- Main content: Markdown
- Diagrams: Mermaid
- Formulae: KaTeX

### Controls
- Advance slide: **right**, **down**, and **space**
- Previous slide: **left**, **up**
- Fullscreen toggle on selected window: **F**
- Clone Window: **C**
    - yes, original and cloned windows are synchronized
    - great for presenting (P-toggle one, and fullscreen the other)
- Presenter's toggle: **P**
- Help: **H**

### Printing and PDF Exports
- Before printing, be sure to flip through every slide! This ensures that all diagrams, formulae, code blocks, etc. are properly rendered.
  - From there, you can use your browser print menu to Print-to-PDF. Use no margins, and experiment with format-size and background toggles.
